# Techlahoma Alcohol Policy

Professionals, hobbyists, and volunteers make up the Techlahoma Foundation and its affiliates, as we come together to advance Oklahoma's grassroots technology community. We are deeply committed to fostering inclusive environments and events that are educational, engaging, and entertaining. 

Alcohol consumption, and its place in our industry, is a very polarizing topic which can bring with it a wealth of different ideas and concerns. In a concerted effort to ensure the safety of our members by mitigating opportunities for over-indulgence, protect the reputation of Techlahoma as a leader in our region, and oversee operation well within state/federal regulations,  we have created an alcohol policy that will serve as a source of solidarity for all Techlahoma Foundation affiliates and partners. 

1. **Involvement and Criteria**
    1. Any User Group (UG) reserves the right and privilege to choose not to include or promote alcohol at their respective events, further designating them as “Dry”.

    1. Sponsored events in which the donor has specified that their funds can be used to provide alcoholic beverages are able to utilize those funds, as needed, for purpose of providing drinks for the event, in accordance with the Alcohol Policy.
1. **After-Hours Events**
    1. Events taking place directly after a Techlahoma-Affiliated Event or Convention, comprised of attendees (aka After-Hours Events, Mixers, Socials, etc., even those held at a separate location), are subject to the rules and expectations detailed in the CoC (i.e. attendees regarding themselves in a professional and collaborative manner at all times).
    1. At outside venues, Techlahoma members are encouraged to be vigilant and watchful for other members and professionally assist them in avoiding any possible dangers.

1. **Grounds for Immediate Dismissal**
    1. Any evidence or observation of an individual placing any kind of illicit foreign substance into the food or drink of their own or someone else (also known as “spiking” or placing a “roofie”), will result in the proper authorities being notified and their immediate dismissal from Techlahoma and a lifetime ban on all future affiliated gatherings.
    1. Any perceived form of aggressive or disorderly behavior toward any attendee or organizer will be met with immediate reprimand in line with the severity of the situation, up to and including a lifetime revocation of membership and the proper authorities being contacted.
    1. Strict adherence to the Techlahoma CoC and State/Local laws must be maintained at all times, failure to do this could result in revocation of membership or any official standing within the organization.
    1. Providing alcohol to anyone under the age of 21 will result in immediate notification of the proper authorities and immediate revocation of all affiliation with Techlahoma and its affiliates.  
    1. Any User Groups that willingly violate the terms or conditions of this policy, or the CoC, are subject to having their status or their Alcohol Privileges revoked until further notice.  


The Techlahoma Alcohol policy should be used as a base for all alcohol-related activity within the organization to assure the safety and security of the organization, but most importantly its members. It is always an attendee’s responsibility to self-regulate their alcohol consumption and maintain safe behavior, but this policy shall serve as a base level of expectation from the Techlahoma Foundation and its Affiliates for any events involving alcohol. 

Techlahoma is committed to offering an inclusive environment for professionals and students to meet and collaborate while understanding that for many people there is often alcohol involved in many casual settings. It is with this mentality that this policy was crafted, but it is also paramount that we possess the due diligence to create a protected and responsible environment. 

We appreciate your adherence to this policy, and encourage anyone with questions to please direct them to the board in writing.  

*Moving forward, all donation applications shall include a specification for donors to opt-in or out to allowing their funds to be used to procure alcohol, so that any individual or institution that otherwise abstains from its use can choose better how their particular funds are spent.   

Note: The Techlahoma Board reserves the right to override any aforementioned rules at their discretion and reserve the right to call for an amendment to this document.
